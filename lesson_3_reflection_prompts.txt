When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   When I want to work from different locations, or with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Auto updates could potentially throw away code that I am currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches link commmits together in chronological order. clones copy repositorys on to the
    users machine.  Forks copy repositories on GitHub, which I would use if I wanted
    to make my own copy or version of somone else's work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can manually merge the branches while offline and keep track of changes made since the last
    time you were online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    In person.  Easier to communicate.  Harder to work at on seperate problems simultaneously.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes in a separate branch makes it easier to get focused feedback on what you're
    working on.
