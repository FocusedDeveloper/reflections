What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository git prepares to start tracking all files in the directory,
which is needed for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area acts as a middle man between the working directory and the user.
Keeps track of what you're going to commit b4 hand so you don't end up with unecassary commmits due to changes.
